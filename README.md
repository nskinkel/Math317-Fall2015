Introduction
------------
You are now reading the main course web page.
The paragraphs below serve as the syllabus for Math 317 Section A.

*This page, as well as the content directory above, and its subdirectories, will
 be updated throughout the semester. Students are expected to visit this
 page periodically.* 

Please bookmark this page or, better yet,
<a href="mailto:?subject=MATH 317 webpage&amp;body=The Math 317 webpage is
 http://github.com/williamdemeo/Math317-Fall2014">click here</a> to email the url of this
 page to yourself!

The ISU Blackboard system will be used only for recording test scores and
grades. Please Note, the Blackboard system often reports cumulative grade totals
that bear little relation to the course grades as they will be computed at
the end of the semester. If you want to find out where you stand in the class,
please keep track of your grades and refer to the
[Grading Policy](#grading-policy) section below.

[Detailed Course Objectives](#detailed-course-objectives) below, or see the Math
Department's generic Math 317 page at http://orion.math.iastate.edu/dept/CoursePages/317/

Textbook Information
--------------------
**Title:** Linear Algebra  
**Author:**  Shifrin and Adams  
**Edition:** 2nd  
**ISBN:**  9781429215213  

It is helpful (but not mandatory) to have a hard copy of the textbook.  Students
should at least have access to an electronic version of the book by Shifrin, or
a comparable linear algebra book. It may be possible for some students to get by
with just the lecture notes, but that is not recommended.

The textbook for this class is very expensive when purchased at the university
bookstore.  Students are free to purchase the book from alternative sources. (At
last check, some Amazon merchants are listing new editions of the book for
around $80). *Please note: shipping delays or other problems that may arrise
when trying to find a cheaper copy of the textbook do not constitute a valid
excuse for failing to submit homework on time.*


Exams
-----
There will be two midterm exams each worth 20%, and a final exam worth 30% of the course grade.

+ **MIDTERM EXAM 1** (focus on Chapters 1 and 2)  
**DATE:** Friday, October 2.  
  
+ **MIDTERM EXAM 2** (focus on Chapters 3 and 4)  
**DATE:** Friday, November 6.  

+ **FINAL EXAM** on Chapters 1--6.  
**DATE:** Monday, December 14, 2015.  
**TIME:** 9:45--11:45am.   
**LOCATION:** Carver 0132.


The final exam will be cumulative, that is, it will cover everything we have
learned during the semester.

In accordance with university policy, the final exam is mandatory and must be
taken by all students at the scheduled time. Do not make travel plans before
the date of the final exam.


Homework
--------
**Late homework will not be accepted or graded.**  

Solving lots of problems is the best way to prepare yourself to do well on the
tests, and ultimately to do well in the course.

The **homework will account for 30% of the course grade** and will be
assigned once per week, typically due each Friday **at the beginning of class.**

Homework submitted at the end of class on the due date will be penalized
10%. **Homework submitted after then end of class on the due date will not be
accepted or graded.**  

At least one (possibly more) of the lowest (or missed) homework scores
will be dropped and not counted toward the final course grade.
*The 10 best homework scores will count toward the final grade.*

The last homework assignment will be due on the Friday of the last week
of the semester, also known as "dead week."  

Make-up Policy
--------------
**No late homework will be accepted for any reason.**  If you fail
to submit homework on time, this will not necessarily hurt
your course grade since the lowest homework scores will be dropped.

Generally speaking, there are no make-up exams. However, 
if you must miss an exam for one of the legitimate reasons listed below,
and if you contact the professor at least five days before the exam date,
then you might be able to take a make-up exam *before* the scheduled exam time.

To request a make-up exam, a student must provide documented evidence of
one of the following:

+ Medical excuse - student's own medical emergency.
+ Medical excuse - a member of the student's family has a medical emergency.
+ Extra curricular activities as a representative of Iowa State University.
+ Armed forces deployment (military duty).
+ Officially mandated court appearances, including jury duty.
+ A conflict with another exam or if you have three or more final exams on a
given day.  (In each case the exam with the fewest students
must arrange the make-up exam.)

If you miss an exam due to some unforeseen circumstance, you must contact the 
professor within one class meeting after the missed test and provide an
explanation. If your excuse is accepted, the missed test score may be replaced 
with 80% of your final exam score. For example, if your excuse is accepted and
you score a 90% on the final, then you will receive a 72% for the missed test
(0.80*0.90 = 0.72).


Grading Policy
--------------
The breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  

+ Final exam: 30 points  
+ Mid-term exams: 40 points (20 each)  
+ Homework: 30 points total  

At the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to
the following table. However, the scale may be shifted,
depending on overall student performance.  All curving (if any)
will occur at the end of the semester.  

+ A: 94--100  
+ A-: 91--93  
+ B+: 87--90   
+ B: 84--86   
+ B-: 81--83   
+ C+: 77--80  
+ C: 74--76   
+ C-: 71--73   
+ D+: 67--70   
+ D: 64--66   
+ D-: 60--63   
+ F:  0--59    

Attendance
----------
Students are expected to attend all classes.
A grade penalty will be exacted if you have an excessive number of absences
(whether excused or unexcused).
Specifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) seven
absences in total. Each absence in addition
to that may result in the deduction of points from your final grade.

In many of the lectures, attendance will be recorded by passing around a sign-in
sheet on which you will print and sign your own name. (If another student asks
you to sign in for them, don't do it! Forging another student's signature
constitutes a violation of the student code of conduct and will be referred to
the ISU Office of Judicial Affairs.)

If you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention
this to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive
to your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings, before the lecture
is over.


3 Ways to Ask Questions
-----------------------

When you don't understand something, please ask a question!

1. **Lecture** The best time/place to ask a question is during lecture or recitation or office hours.

2. **Piazza** Another good place to ask a question is online discussion forum.
   This term we will be using [Piazza][] for class discussion and all students
   should enroll in this forum by visiting the [Piazza signup page][].

   This system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from
   classmates, the TA, and the professor. Rather than emailing questions to the
   teaching staff, students are encouraged to post questions on Piazza forum.
   If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email
   [team@piazza.com](mailto:team@piazza.com). 

   Our class Piazza page is at: https://piazza.com/iastate/fall2015/math317/home


Email Policy
------------
You may email the instructor directly, though the response
time will generally be slower than if you use one of the preferred methods
described above.

If you email the instructor, you *must* use an informative subject field.
If you use <a href="mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=MATH 317:
(fill in subject here)&amp;body=Dear Dr. DeMeo, (your message) Sincerely, (your full name)">this
link</a>  to email the professor, then some of the required information should
pre-populate your message fields.  If you do not at least
indicate which class you are in, your email may be ignored.


Use of Electronics During Lecture
---------------------------------
Silence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets,
microwave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.  The only exception to
this policy is the use of computers or tablets for the purpose of referring to
an electronic copy of the textbook, or the online (WebAssign) homework
problems. Using a computer during lecture to check Facebook, for
example, is totally unacceptable. Besides how this affects your own ability to
focus on what is being taught in the lecture, computers can be very distracting 
to other students. **Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated
to calculus will not be tolerated.**


Academic Honesty
----------------
Cheating will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy will be referred to
and dealt with by the ISU Office of Judicial Affairs, in a  manner consistent
with university regulations, which range from a warning to expulsion from the
university.


Classroom Policy
----------------
In this course, we follow the general university classroom policy: http://www.math.iastate.edu/Faculty/ClassPolicies.html


Students With Disabilities
--------------------------
If you have a documented disability
or if you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the
Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act and requires accommodations, you should contact the Student Disability
Resources Office for information on appropriate policies and procedures.

**The Disability Resources Office**  
Student Services Building, Room 1076  
phone: 515-294-6624, or 515-294-7220, or TDD 294-6335  
email: [disabilityresources@iastate.edu](mailto:disabilityresources@iastate.edu) or
[accommodations@iastate.edu](mailto:accommodations@iastate.edu).

You must obtain a Student Academic Accommodation Request (SAAR) from the Disability
Resources office and you must contact your instructor early in the semester so
that your learning needs may be appropriately met. 

Your instructor will be happy to assist with accommodations, but will not
provide them retroactively, **so the appropriate requests and paperwork 
should be filed well before the first exam.**

More information about disability resources in the Mathematics Department can be
found at http://www.math.iastate.edu/Undergrad/AccommodationPol.html.
