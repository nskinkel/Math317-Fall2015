%%test This is the Homework LaTeX template.  Use this file to fill in your solutions. 
%%
%% Notes: 
%%    1. Write your answers inside a \begin{solution}...\end{solution} environment.
%%
%%    2. If you will use references, insert bibtex reference entries in the file
%%       Math317.bib.  (Create that file if it doesn't yet exist.)
%%
%%    3. If you will use acronyms, please define them in the macros.tex file.
%%
%%    4. Please try to check that your file compiles:
%%
%%       Mac OS X users: you might try MacTeX. 
%%       Windows users: you might try proTeXt. 
%%       Linux users: most come with TeX; otherwise do a full install of TeXLive.
%%
%%       There is a Makefile in this directory, so on Linux you could just 
%%       enter `make` to compile all the Homework*.tex files at once.
%%
%%    5. Please don't hesitate to inform the prof if you have trouble, or open
%%       a ``New issue'' or create a new ``Wiki page'' on GitHub.  Otherwise,
%%       send an email to williamdemeo@gmail.com.
%%
%%    6. It will probably be hard to keep everyone's notation consistent.
%%       For the most basic symbols, we should have some conventions and use
%%       LaTeX macros to keep the conventions consistent and easy to remember.
%%       For example, to denote an algebra,
         \newcommand\alg[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbf{#1}}}
         \newcommand{\<}{\ensuremath{\langle}}
         \renewcommand{\>}{\ensuremath{\rangle}}
%%       So, an algebra in LaTeX is typed as $\alg{A} = \<A, F\>$.
%%       Similarly, for a field, let's use:
         \newcommand\fld[1]{\ensuremath{\mathbb{#1}}}
%%       So, a field in LaTeX is typed as $\fld{F}$.


         \newcommand\va{\vec{a}}
         \newcommand\vu{\vec{u}}
         \newcommand\vv{\vec{v}}
         \newcommand\vw{\vec{w}}
         \newcommand\vx{\vec{x}}
         \newcommand\vy{\vec{y}}
         \newcommand\vz{\vec{z}}
         \newcommand\vzero{\vec{0}}
         \newcommand\sP{\ensuremath{\mathscr P}}
         \newcommand\Span{\ensuremath{\operatorname{Span}}}

\noindent {\bf General Hints:}
When you are asked to ``show'' or ``prove'' something, you should make it a
point to write down clearly the information you are given and what it is you are
to show. One word of warning regarding the second part of Problem  1.1.22: 
To say that $\vec{v}$ is a linear combination of $\vec{v}_1, \dots, \vec{v}_k$
is to say that 
$\vec{v} = c_1\vec{v}_1 + c_2\vec{v}_2 +\cdots + c_k\vec{v}_k$ for some scalars 
$c_1,\dots, c_k$. These scalars
will surely be different when you express a different vector $\vec{w}$ 
as a linear combination of $\vec{v}_1, \dots, \vec{v}_k$, so be sure you give
the scalars for $\vec{w}$ different names. \\

(``SA 1.1.21'' means exercise 21 in Section 1.1 of textbook by 
{\bf S}hifrin and {\bf A}dams.)\\[4pt]

%--  PROBLEM 0  ---------------------------------------------------
\noindent {\it Problem} 0 (SA 1.1.28). Carefully prove the following properties
of vector arithmetic. Justify all steps. 
Optional: Give the geometric interpretation of each property in case 
$n=2$ or $n=3$.  \\
You are required to turn proofs for e. f. g. (but you are encouraged to try 
them all).
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
\item 
For all $\vx, \vy \in \R^n$ , $\vx + \vy = \vy + \vx$.
\item 
For all $\vx, \vy, \vz \in \R^n$, $(\vx + \vy) + \vz = \vx + (\vy + \vz)$.
\item 
For all $\vx\in \R^n$, $\vzero + \vx = \vx$ for all $\vx \in \R^n$.
\item 
For each $\vx\in \R^n$, there is a vector $−\vx$ so that $\vx + (−\vx) = \vzero$.
\item 
For all $c, d \in \R^n$ and $\vx \in \R^n$, $c(d\vx) = (cd)\vx$.
\item 
For all $c \in \R$ and $\vx, \vy \in \R^n$ , $c(\vx + \vy) = c\vx + c\vy$.
\item 
For all $c, d \in \R$ and $\vx \in \R^n$, $(c + d)\vx = c\vx + d\vx$.
\item 
For all $\vx \in \R^n$, $1\vx = \vx$.
