If you want to find out where you stand in the class,\r\nplease keep track of your grades and refer to the\r\n[Grading Policy](#grading-policy) section below.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass Meeting Times\r\n-------------------\r\n**Lecture:** MTTF 10--10:50am Carver 0001.\r\n\r\nOverview, Prerequisites, Outcomes\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Overview**  \r\n\r\nThis course emphasizes the reading and writing of mathematical proofs realted to\r\nlinear algebra. We will cover chapters most of Chapters 1 through 6\r\nof [the textbook](#textbook). Some topics covered are the following:\r\n\r\n+ Vectors, matrices, linear equations;  \r\n+ Matrix algebra;  \r\n+ Vector spaces;  \r\n+ Projections, linear transformations, determinants;  \r\n+ Eigenvalues, eigenvectors;  \r\n+ Some applications if time permits.  \r\n\r\n**Prerequisites**  \r\n\r\nMath 165, Math 166 or equivalent, Math 201 at the same time or earlier; Math 265 also is suggested. \r\n\r\n**Learning Outcomes**  \r\n\r\nStudents will gain proficiency in reading and writing proofs, as well as solving\r\ncomputational problems, concerning the following topics: systems of linear equations,\r\ndeterminants, vector spaces, inner product spaces, linear transformations,\r\neigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalization of linear transformations. \r\n\r\nSee the list of [Course Objectives](#course-objectives) below for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nTextbook Information\r\n--------------------\r\n**Title:** Linear Algebra  \r\n**Author:**  Shifrin and Adams  \r\n**Edition:** 2nd  \r\n**ISBN:**  9781429215213  \r\n\r\nIt is helpful (but not mandatory) to have a hard copy of the textbook.  Students\r\nshould at least have access to an electronic version of the book by Shifrin, or\r\na comparable linear algebra book. It may be possible for some students to get by\r\nwith just the lecture notes, but that is not recommended.\r\n\r\nThe textbook for this class is very expensive when purchased at the university\r\nbookstore.  Students are free to purchase the book from alternative sources. (At\r\nlast check, some Amazon merchants are listing new editions of the book for\r\naround $80). *Please note: shipping delays or other problems that may arrise\r\nwhen trying to find a cheaper copy of the textbook do not constitute a valid\r\nexcuse for failing to submit homework on time.*\r\n\r\n\r\nExams\r\n-----\r\nThere will be two midterm exams each worth 20%, and a final exam worth 30% of the course grade.\r\n\r\n+ **MIDTERM EXAM 1** (focus on Chapters 1 and 2)  \r\n**DATE:** Friday, October 2.  \r\n  \r\n+ **MIDTERM EXAM 2** (focus on Chapters 3 and 4)  \r\n**DATE:** Friday, November 6.  \r\n\r\n+ **FINAL EXAM** on Chapters 1--6.  \r\n**DATE:** Monday, December 14, 2015.  \r\n**TIME:** 9:45--11:45am.   \r\n**LOCATION:** Carver 0132.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe final exam will be cumulative, that is, it will cover everything we have\r\nlearned during the semester.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with university policy, the final exam is mandatory and must be\r\ntaken by all students at the scheduled time. Do not make travel plans before\r\nthe date of the final exam.\r\n\r\n\r\nHomework\r\n--------\r\n**Late homework will not be accepted or graded.**  \r\n\r\nSolving lots of problems is the best way to prepare yourself to do well on the\r\ntests, and ultimately to do well in the course.\r\n\r\nThe **homework will account for 30% of the course grade** and will be\r\nassigned once per week, typically due each Friday **at the beginning of class.**\r\n\r\nHomework submitted at the end of class on the due date will be penalized\r\n10%. **Homework submitted after then end of class on the due date will not be\r\naccepted or graded.**  \r\n\r\nAt least one (possibly more) of the lowest or missed homework scores\r\nwill be dropped and not counted toward the final course grade.\r\n*The 10 best homework scores will count toward the final grade.*\r\n\r\nThe last homework assignment will be due on the Friday of the last week\r\nof the semester, also known as \"dead week.\"  \r\n\r\nMake-up Policy\r\n--------------\r\n**No late homework will be accepted for any reason.**  If you fail\r\nto submit homework on time, this will not necessarily hurt\r\nyour course grade since the lowest homework scores will be dropped.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, there are no make-up exams. However, \r\nif you must miss an exam for one of the legitimate reasons listed below,\r\nand if you contact the professor at least five days before the exam date,\r\nthen you might be able to take a make-up exam *before* the scheduled exam time.\r\n\r\nTo request a make-up exam, a student must provide documented evidence of\r\none of the following:\r\n\r\n+ Medical excuse - student's own medical emergency.\r\n+ Medical excuse - a member of the student's family has a medical emergency.\r\n+ Extra curricular activities as a representative of Iowa State University.\r\n+ Armed forces deployment (military duty).\r\n+ Officially mandated court appearances, including jury duty.\r\n+ A conflict with another exam or if you have three or more final exams on a\r\ngiven day.  (In each case the exam with the fewest students\r\nmust arrange the make-up exam.)\r\n\r\nIf you miss an exam due to some unforeseen circumstance, you must contact the \r\nprofessor within one class meeting after the missed test and provide an\r\nexplanation. If your excuse is accepted, the missed test score may be replaced \r\nwith 80% of your final exam score. For example, if your excuse is accepted and\r\nyou score a 90% on the final, then you will receive a 72% for the missed test\r\n(0.80*0.90 = 0.72).\r\n\r\n\r\nGrading Policy\r\n--------------\r\nThe breakdown of the final course grade is as follows:  \r\n\r\n+ Final exam: 30 points  \r\n+ Mid-term exams: 40 points (20 each)  \r\n+ Homework: 30 points total  \r\n\r\nAt the end of the semester, letter grades will be assigned roughly according to\r\nthe following table. However, the scale may be shifted,\r\ndepending on overall student performance.  All curving (if any)\r\nwill occur at the end of the semester.  \r\n\r\n+ A: 94--100  \r\n+ A-: 91--93  \r\n+ B+: 87--90   \r\n+ B: 84--86   \r\n+ B-: 81--83   \r\n+ C+: 77--80  \r\n+ C: 74--76   \r\n+ C-: 71--73   \r\n+ D+: 67--70   \r\n+ D: 64--66   \r\n+ D-: 60--63   \r\n+ F:  0--59    \r\n\r\nAttendance\r\n----------\r\nStudents are expected to attend all classes.\r\nA grade penalty will be exacted if you have an excessive number of absences\r\n(whether excused or unexcused).\r\nSpecifically, you are permitted (but strongly discouraged from taking) seven\r\nabsences in total. Each absence in addition\r\nto that may result in the deduction of points from your final grade.\r\n\r\nIn many of the lectures, attendance will be recorded by passing around a sign-in\r\nsheet on which you will print and sign your own name. (If another student asks\r\nyou to sign in for them, don't do it! Forging another student's signature\r\nconstitutes a violation of the student code of conduct and will be referred to\r\nthe ISU Office of Judicial Affairs.)\r\n\r\nIf you plan to leave before class is over, the correct procedure is to mention\r\nthis to the professor before the start of class. It is impolite and disruptive\r\nto your classmates to leave, or even pack up your belongings, before the lecture\r\nis over.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsking Questions\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWhen you don't understand something, please ask a question!\r\n\r\n1. **In Lecture.** The best time/place to ask a question is during lecture or recitation or office hours.\r\n\r\n2. **On Piazza.** Another good place to ask a question is the online discussion\r\n   forum.\r\n   This term we will be using [Piazza][] for class discussion and all students\r\n   should enroll in this forum by visiting the [Piazza signup page][].\r\n\r\n   This system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from\r\n   classmates, the TA, and the professor. Rather than emailing questions to the\r\n   teaching staff, students are encouraged to post questions on Piazza forum.\r\n   If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email\r\n   [team@piazza.com](mailto:team@piazza.com). \r\n\r\n   Our class Piazza page is at: https://piazza.com/iastate/fall2015/math317/home\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail Policy\r\n------------\r\nYou may email the instructor directly, though the response\r\ntime will generally be slower than if you use one of the preferred methods\r\ndescribed above.\r\n\r\nIf you email the instructor, you *must* use an informative subject field.\r\nIf you use <a href=\"mailto:williamdemeo@gmail.com?subject=MATH 317:\r\n(fill in subject here)&amp;body=Dear Dr. DeMeo, (your message) Sincerely, (your full name)\">this\r\nlink</a>  to email the professor, then some of the required information should\r\npre-populate your message fields.  If you do not at least\r\nindicate which class you are in, your email may be ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse of Electronics During Lecture\r\n---------------------------------\r\nSilence and refrain from using all electronic devices (phones, ipods, tablets,\r\nmicrowave ovens, etc.) during class and exam periods.\r\nUsing a computer during lecture to check Facebook, for example, is totally\r\nunacceptable. Besides how this affects your own ability to focus on what is\r\nbeing taught in the lecture, computers can be very distracting to other\r\nstudents. **Use of electronic devices in lecture for purposes unrelated \r\nto math will not be tolerated.**\r\n\r\n\r\nAcademic Honesty\r\n----------------\r\nCheating is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Violations of this policy\r\nwill be referred to and dealt with by the ISU Office of Judicial Affairs, in a\r\nmanner consistent with university regulations, which range from a warning to\r\nexpulsion from the university.\r\n\r\n\r\nClassroom Policy\r\n----------------\r\nIn this course, we follow the general university classroom policy:\r\nhttp://www.math.iastate.edu/Faculty/ClassPolicies.html\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents With Disabilities\r\n--------------------------\r\nIf you have a documented disability\r\nor if you believe that you have a disability that qualifies under the\r\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\r\nAct and requires accommodations, you should contact the Student Disability\r\nResources Office for information on appropriate policies and procedures.\r\n\r\n**The Disability Resources Office**  \r\nStudent Services Building, Room 1076  \r\nphone: 515-294-6624, or 515-294-7220, or TDD 294-6335  \r\nemail: [disabilityresources@iastate.edu](mailto:disabilityresources@iastate.edu) or\r\n[accommodations@iastate.edu](mailto:accommodations@iastate.edu).\r\n\r\nYou must obtain a Student Academic Accommodation Request (SAAR) from the Disability\r\nResources office and you must contact your instructor early in the semester so\r\nthat your learning needs may be appropriately met. \r\n\r\nYour instructor will be happy to assist with accommodations, but will not\r\nprovide them retroactively, **so the appropriate requests and paperwork \r\nshould be filed well before the first exam.**\r\n\r\nMore information about disability resources in the Mathematics Department can be\r\nfound at http://www.math.iastate.edu/Undergrad/AccommodationPol.html. \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCourse Objectives\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n+ Be able to reduce a matrix to row canonical form and solve the\r\n  system of linear equations Ax = B.  \r\n+ Be able to prove that the row canonical form of a matrix is unique.  \r\n+ Know the Elementary row operation matrices and use them in proofs.  \r\n+ Know the Elementary column operation matrices and use them in proofs.  \r\n+ Know the algebraic operations of matrices and proof of associativity.  \r\n+ Know the characteristic polynomial, the relationship between the \r\n  roots of the characteristic polynomial and the minimal polynomial. \r\n  Know the relationship between these roots and the blocks of the \r\n  Jordan Canonical Form.  \r\n+ Know diagonalization of matrices and the theorems about its existance.  \r\n+ Understand the definitions of linear independence and spanning and be \r\n  able to prove every spanning set can be reduced to a basis and any\r\n  independent set can be augmented to a basis.  \r\n+ Know the definition of a determinant as the signed volume of an ordered\r\n  simplex. and be able to prove the basic properties of the determinants from \r\n  this definition, including  Det[AB] = Det[A] Det[B].  \r\n+ Know the definition of a linear transformation and be able to set \r\n  up the matrix of a linear transformation on a finite dimensional \r\n  vector space.  \r\n+ Know the definition of an eigenvalue and an eigenvector and be \r\n  able to compute then for low dimension matrices.  \r\n+ Know the basic properties of the dot product and how to compute \r\n  distances from points to planes, points to lines, angles between \r\n  planes, angles between lines.
